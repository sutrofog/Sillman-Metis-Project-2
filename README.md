**Project Title: A Model to Set Rents in San Francisco**

- **Description**: The residential rental market in San Francisco is changing rapidly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rents are dropping and inventory is growing now that people working from home have realized that they can work from anywhere, and no longer need to pay exorbitant rent to live in San Francisco. Because the market is changing so quickly, it may be challenging for landlords to set a reasonable rental amount for an apartment they are putting on the market. I propose to develop a model that will propse a reasonable rent for an apartment in San Francisco, given certain features of the apartment such as number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood, and other considerations.
- **Features**: Number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, and neighborhood. 
- **Target Variable**: Monthly rent
- **Data Used**: Data was scraped from a Craigslist apartment search within the city of San Francisco. Single family homes were excluded from the search.
- **Tools Used**: BeautifulSoup, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Google Slides.
- **Possible impacts of my project**: To enable landlords to set reasonable rental rates for apartments coming onto the San Francisco market, thus stabilizing the rental market. To empower prospective renters to know what a reasonable rent would be for an apartment they are considering, given factors such as neighborhood, number of bedrooms, square footage, and other features.
